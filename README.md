Student Record Management System Course: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project Title: Student Record Management Using Linked Lists (Doubly LinkedList)

Program Description: This program is a console-based application designed to manage student records using a doubly linked list. It demonstrates key principles of object-oriented programming such as encapsulation, abstraction, and modular design.

Main features include:

Adding student records at the beginning, end, or a specific position
Deleting student records by ID
Searching for student records by ID or name
Updating student information
Displaying all student records with forward and backward navigation
The program is organized into the following classes:

Student: stores student details
Node: represents a node in the linked list
DoublyLinkedList: manages the list and its operations
Program: handles user interaction and menu display
How to Run the Program:

Open the project in a C# development environment such as Visual Studio.
Ensure the following files are included in the project:
Student.cs
Node.cs
DoublyLinkedList.cs
Program.cs
Build the project to check for any errors.
Run the program. A menu will appear in the console.
Follow the instructions to add, delete, search, update, or view student records.
To exit the program, select option 6 from the menu.
Additional Notes:

The program includes input validation to ensure correct data entry.
The doubly linked list allows both forward and backward navigation of records.
The interface is menu-driven and easy to use.
